# Challenges

1. What happens if you try to go to a route that doesn't exist for example `/products`? Why don't you create a new route that the users will fall to if there's no specific route setup. _`Tip: you can use regular expression in the path.`_
2. You might have noticed that we're not touching the address. Why don't you create a component to update the address and can be re-use later on?
3. Right now we're only updating an existing supplier, what if we want to create a new one? You might have noticed that the **createSupplier** method is already available in the **SupplierService**. Give it a try.
