# Challenges

1. You might have noticed that we're not touching the address. Why don't you create a component to update the address and can be re-use later on?
2. Right now we're only updating an existing supplier, what if we want to create a new one? You might have noticed that the **createSupplier** method is already available in the **SupplierService**. Give it a try.
