# Your First CLI App

### Using the CLI

```text
vue create northwind-traders
```

![We&apos;re going to manually select features](../.gitbook/assets/vue-create.jpg)

![And for now, all we need is Babel and Linter](../.gitbook/assets/vue-create-options.jpg)

We can run the application now with the commands below:

```text
cd northwind-traders
npm run serve
```

### Using the UI

We can achieve the very same thing using the Vue UI. Let's give it a try

```text
vue ui
```

![The Vue UI should up and running on port 8000](../.gitbook/assets/vue-ui-cmd.jpg)

![The Vue UI should open automatically](../.gitbook/assets/vue-ui.jpg)

We'll follow the same steps to create a project as we did through the CLI. Let's click on **Create**

![](../.gitbook/assets/vue-ui-create.jpg)

Then select a path and **Create a new project here**

![](../.gitbook/assets/vue-ui-create-1.jpg)

Give it a name and which package manager you want to use

![](../.gitbook/assets/vue-ui-create-2.jpg)

We're going to select some manual features and click on **Next**

![](../.gitbook/assets/vue-ui-create-3.jpg)

We'll keep the default features for now, but it's good to know we could select more here and click **Next**

Finally, let's create the project

![](../.gitbook/assets/vue-ui-create-5.jpg)

If you want, you can save this preset for later. Since it's just the default, we're going to **Continue without saving**

![](../.gitbook/assets/vue-ui-create-6.jpg)

And we're done

![](../.gitbook/assets/vue-ui-create-7.jpg)

Let's run the application now
