# Overview

In this section, we're going to start building a more complex application leveraging the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org), looking into how to create multiple components and how they all fit together, but before we get there we need to setup a few things.

### Requirements

* **VS Code**: at this point you should have it installed already, but if you don't, it's never too late. Go and grab the latest version in this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* **Node.js**: from this section onward we're going Node.js quite extensively. Install it using this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* **Vue CLI**: we'll go through the details on how to install it, but you can find more information [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
* **VS Code Extensions**: not mandatory, but highly recommended: [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) and [Vue VSCode Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-snippets)

### Installing Vue CLI

```text
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

With all these install, we're ready to rock! Let's go forward.
