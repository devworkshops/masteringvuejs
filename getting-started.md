# Getting Started

## Installing CLI

There are a few ways to start with your new Vue.js application. One of them is referencing a CDN \([https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue)\), but during this course we're going to focus on the [CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org).

 You'll [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed beforehand.
{% endhint %}

```bash
$ npm i -g @vue/cli
```

## Creating your first app

The Vue.js CLI has plenty of options, it's very self explainatory and the navigation is very easy, but for now we'll stick with the default.

```bash
vue create my-new-app
cd my-new-app
npm run serve 
```

Once we do that, our brand new app should be running on http://localhost:8080
