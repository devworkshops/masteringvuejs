# Creating First App

The Vue.js CLI has plenty of options, it's very self explainatory and the navigation is very easy, but for now we'll stick with the default.

```bash
$ vue create my-new-app
$ cd my-new-app
$ npm run serve
```

Once we do that, our brand new app should be running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
