# Challenges

1. Add a **Dismiss all notifications** feature. This feature should leverage appropriate mutations and actions.
2. The new notifications feature is great, but there is a lot of boilerplate code to catch and raise notifications. Combine what you have learned about Axios interceptors and Vuex state management to create a global solution for handling errors in HTTP requests.
